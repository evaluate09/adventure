### 1. Branching <br>
So you will notice that there are branches. Different people, different project versions, different branches you should upload to. They'll have changes with them, but the branch called "main" is the original project. **IMPORTANT!! Please do not upload to the main branch, instead create a new branch and upload there instead.**

### 2. Pull Requests <br>
Once you believe your branch should be the main code, make a pull request and I will merge your branch with the main one.

### 3. Fuck it this is google drive now but fancier
